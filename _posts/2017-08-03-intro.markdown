This API is always tested with the latest GA release of SSC, starting with 17.2.

## What's in the box?
- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
- Javascript ES6
- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) testing framework 

## Mocha
Mocha is a testing framework that allows the running of test suites comprised of test cases. 
Normally a [component]_spec.js is one test suite that performs test for that component.
This project consists of a few spec files that perform different tasks on SSC via the REST API.

## Swagger
Swagger allows the generation of code from a spec file that SSC provides. SSC hosts a spec file generated based on the API calls exposed.

## Swagger-js

This project uses the js implementation of code generation based on the spec file.
See [Swagger](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js/tree/2.x) for more detail (we use version 2.x since SSC exposes that version, different than 3.x).

<pre><code class="javascript">
...
//restClient.js
new Swagger({
        url: `${config.sscAPIBase}/spec.json`, //this loads the spec file from SSC
        usePromise: true,
    }).then((api) => {
        console.log("successfully loaded swagger spec. Attempting to call heartbeat /features ");
        that.api = api;
        async.waterfall([
            function getToken(callback) {
